# TMMC-S24-Automated-Guided-Vehicles

Objective:
The Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC) Engineering project team aims to implement a reliable solution for utilizing Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to efficiently transport vehicle components to designated stations within a manufacturing environment. The AGVs must navigate from pickup to delivery points while avoiding collisions with static fixtures and other AGVs, and obeying traffic signals, such as stop signs. The primary objective is to minimize the time required for each delivery, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.
